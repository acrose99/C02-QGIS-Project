# C02-QGIS-Project
Thing I did to visualize C02 emissons, please check the HTML file if you wanna learn more and see what I did.
You can also download the actual qGIS file, but most of the Data won't be imported, but the sources are provided in the HTML so you can import that data, then play around with it.
